    <h1>Segmented Least Squares Algorithm</h1>
    <p>
      The Segmented Least Squares algorithm is a technique used in statistics
      and machine learning to fit a piecewise linear function to a set of data
      points.
    </p>
    <p>
      The algorithm works by dividing the data into segments and fitting a
      separate line to each segment. The lines are then joined together to form
      the piecewise linear function.
    </p>
    <h2>Algorithm Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Divide the data into segments.</li>
      <li>Fit a line to each segment using the least squares method.</li>
      <li>
        Calculate the total sum of squares of the residuals (the differences
        between the actual data points and the fitted lines).
      </li>
      <li>
        Try different segmentations by combining adjacent segments and
        re-fitting the lines. Calculate the sum of squares of the residuals for
        each segmentation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select the segmentation with the lowest sum of squares of the residuals.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Suppose we have the following set of data:</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>x</th>
          <th>y</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3</td>
          <td>6</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>4</td>
          <td>5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>5</td>
          <td>3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>6</td>
          <td>1</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      By applying the Segmented Least Squares algorithm, we can fit a piecewise
      linear function to this data:

    <p>
      In this example, the algorithm divides the data into two segments: (1,2)
      to (3,6) and (4,5) to (6,1). It fits a line to each segment and joins them
      together to form the piecewise linear function.
